// M2b Task 17 slice 10 (fulla-sdk-refactor, design.md §6's directory
// layout: "pkce/ jwk/ # PKCE、JWK 签名（经 ICryptoProvider 端口）"):
// relocates JwkManager from OAuth2Plugin/include/oauth2/utils/JwkManager.h
// into libs/oauth2 (Domain layer), now that slices 8-9 removed its two
// blockers (hardcoded DrogonLogger dependency; hardcoded
// fulla::drogon::adapters::OpenSslCryptoProvider dependency for base64url).
//
// Behavior/API is otherwise UNCHANGED from the pre-move class (same
// method signatures, same init-once-then-read-only concurrency contract,
// same OpenSSL RS256 signing implementation) -- this is a pure relocation
// plus a default-logger-fallback change (see the constructor doc below).
// OAuth2Plugin/include/oauth2/utils/JwkManager.h becomes a thin
// compatibility shim (`using JwkManager = fulla::oauth2::JwkManager`)
// so the many existing `oauth2::JwkManager`/`using oauth2::JwkManager`
// call sites across OAuth2Plugin/OAuth2Server do not need to change in
// this slice (design.md's namespace-sync-everywhere pass is explicitly a
// later task, M8 Task 40).

/**
 * @brief Manages RSA signing keys for OpenID Connect id_token.
 *
 * Loads RSA private keys from a keystore directory (#110-B), a single PEM
 * file / env var (legacy single-key sources), or an ephemeral dev fallback.
 * Signs JWT tokens with the ACTIVE key (RS256); verifies by routing on the
 * JWT header kid across ALL loaded keys, so outstanding tokens signed by a
 * since-retired key keep verifying while its public half is still published.
 * Exposes every loaded public key in JWK format for /.well-known/jwks.json.
 *
 * ── Keystore directory (#110-B rotation) ─────────────────────────────────
 * config "signing_keystore_dir" points at a directory of
 *   <kid>.pem        one RSA private key per file, filename = kid
 *   active_kid       a one-line text file naming the signing kid
 * Rotation procedure (JwkManager is init-once/read-only by contract, so each
 * step restarts the server -- see docs/operate/configuration-guide.md §9):
 *   1. drop the new <kid>.pem in, restart  -> both keys published in JWKS,
 *      old key keeps signing;
 *   2. flip active_kid to the new kid, restart -> new key signs, old still
 *      published for verification;
 *   3. after the max token lifetime has passed, remove the old <kid>.pem,
 *      restart -> old key fully retired.
 *
 * ── Concurrency contract: init-once, then read-only ─────────────────────
 * This class follows an "initialize exactly once during startup, read-only
 * at runtime" contract:
 *   - init() MUST be called exactly once, before the server begins
 *     accepting requests. init() is the ONLY mutating method; a second
 *     call logs an error and is a no-op (does NOT re-allocate keys_ or
 *     overwrite activeKid_), removing the run-time mutation entry point.
 *   - signJwt(), getJwks(), getKeyId(), isInitialized() are all const and
 *     only read the key state; safe to call concurrently from many
 *     threads with no per-call locking, PROVIDED init() has already
 *     completed-before (happens-before) the first concurrent read (the
 *     production wiring publishes this object as
 *     std::shared_ptr<const JwkManager> after init() to enforce this at
 *     the type level -- see OAuth2Plugin::initAndStart()).
 *
 * OpenSSL concurrency assumption: see the comment on signJwt() --
 * concurrent signing is safe only under OpenSSL >= 1.1.0 with threads
 * enabled.
